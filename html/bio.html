      <div class="careerDiv">
        <p>Born and raised in Philadelphia, PA, I learned from an early age that I had a love for technology and music. This led me initially to find a career in the music industry, specifically in sound engineering.</p>
        <p>
          I studied at The Los Angeles Recording School and during this time I was able to work with many different musicians helping them capture their performances as perfectly as possible!</p>
        <p>While I was not meant for the music industry forever, the exposure to technology and especially problem solving eventually led me to pursue a career as a software engineer. I was immediately drawn to the satisfaction of solving a problem with code. I also love that there is not just one way to do things, but many ways. Music taught me to be creative, and coding has taught me that creativity is the name of the game.</p>
        <p>
          I am extremely excited to start my career as a developer! I cannot wait to start working with a team and helping build the tools that make our world go round.</p>

      <div class="personalDiv">
      <p>
      When not working on a project or learning new skills, I love spending time with my wife and daughter. You can often find us hiking one of the many beautiful trails in eastern Washington with our dog, or going down to the river for a swim and a float during the summer. My daughter also loves music, so playing her records from my vinyl collection or playing guitar for her myself bring me tons of joy!
      </p>
      <p>I am an active golfer, and I love combining the beauty of the outdoors with the mental challenge of staying focused and disciplined during a round. After a round there is nothing better than supporting one of the local breweries in our home city of Spokane, WA!
