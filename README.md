# Casey O'Neil Portfolio Project


## Approach Taken
For this project, I started by getting all of my pages made and then set them up so they were "linked" together. This way I had the general flow of the website. I waited for any type of formatting until I was happy with the actual functionality of the page.  



I did find that some formatting, for instance flexbox implementation was better to do while I was working on the functionality. For example my main button bar in the header, I started by just getting the jquery methods working (the animate method and the drop drop down menu), although I found when I wanted to go back and make them flexbox elements I had to redo some things that may have been easier, or more efficient to tackle while I was initially setting it up.  



## Technologies Used
I utilized CSS for all styling, as well as FlexBox.  

CSS media queries were used to increase the responsiveness for tablet, and phone display.  

I also used jQuery functions for interaction with the site. Methods used were the .animate(), .stop() .css(), .slideToggle(), .click(), .mouseenter(), and .mouseleave().
